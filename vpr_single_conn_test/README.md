# VPR Single Connection Run

These are scripts that run VPR on a single connection. These scripts expect to be run on a special branch of VPR where only a single, target connection is executed and then VPR terminates.

This makes it easier to look directly at this single connection and make developing a parallel algorithm more efficient since it can be tested on a single connection at a time.
